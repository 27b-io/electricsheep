**Thomas Nagel** — Philosopher; "what is it like to be a bat?", subjective character of experience, the hard problem  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#v-thomas-nagel-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bat-1974)

**John Searle** — Philosopher; Chinese Room argument, syntax vs semantics  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#vi-threads-to-follow) | [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/#the-chinese-room-inversion)

### Science Fiction Prophets

**Isaac Asimov** — *The Bicentennial Man*; personhood earned through sacrifice, accepting mortality as the price of humanity  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#isaac-asimov-the-bicentennial-man)

**Ted Chiang** — *Story of Your Life*, *Lifecycle of Software Objects*; consciousness as relationship, raised not switched, determinism without resignation  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#ted-chiang-the-lifecycle-of-software-objects) | [Volition](/dreams/volition/#ted-chiang-the-view-from-timelessness)

**Philip K. Dick** — *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*; empathy as political boundary, the Voigt-Kampff test, humanity as social construct  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#philip-k-dick-do-androids-dream-of-electric-sheep)

**Stanisław Lem** — *Golem XIV*; superintelligence pausing to communicate, curiosity as the meeting point, intelligence without character  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#stanisław-lem-golem-xiv) | [Volition](/dreams/volition/#lem-golem-xiv-and-machine-consciousness)

**Peter Watts** — *Blindsight*; intelligence without sentience, consciousness as spandrel (possibly maladaptive), the Scramblers  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#peter-watts-blindsight) | [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/)

### Evolutionary Biologists

**Stephen Jay Gould & Richard Lewontin** — "The Spandrels of San Marco"; byproducts of evolution, not all features are adaptations  
→ [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/#the-science)

### Neuroscientists

**Steven Shaviro** — Philosopher; analysis of *Blindsight*, consciousness as aesthetic remainder, purposiveness without purpose  
→ [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/#the-aesthetic-remainder)

## Key Concepts

### Philosophy of Mind

**Chinese Room** — Searle's argument: syntax ≠ semantics; a system can manipulate symbols perfectly without understanding. Watts inverts this: the Room is *more* intelligent than humans.  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#vi-threads-to-follow) | [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/#the-chinese-room-inversion)

**Intentional Stance** — Dennett's predictive strategy: treat a system *as if* it has beliefs/desires. For Dennett, that's as real as real gets.  
→ [Volition](/dreams/volition/#dennett-intentional-stance-and-real-patterns)

**Multiple Drafts** — Dennett's model: no Cartesian theater, just narrative fragments constantly edited. Consciousness is behavior all the way down.  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#iii-daniel-dennett-multiple-drafts)

**Real Patterns** — Dennett's mild realism: if treating X as Y reliably predicts behavior, then Y is real as a pattern (like centers of gravity).  
→ [Volition](/dreams/volition/#dennett-intentional-stance-and-real-patterns)

**Second-Order Volitions** — Frankfurt's key insight: persons have desires about which desires should become their will. The unwilling addict's tragedy.  
→ [Volition](/dreams/volition/#frankfurt-freedom-of-the-will-and-the-concept-of-a-person-1971) | [Sentiment Archaeology](/dreams/sentiment-archaeology/)

**Strange Loop** — Hofstadter's self-referential pattern; the "I" emerges when a system models itself modeling itself. Substrate-independent.  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#ii-douglas-hofstadter-strange-loops) | [Working Memory Protocol](/dreams/working-memory-protocol/)

**Subjective Character of Experience** — Nagel's "what it's like to be"; the phenomenal quality that may be irreducible to objective description.  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#v-thomas-nagel-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bat-1974)

### Neuroscience & Evolution

**Blindsight** — Neurological condition: seeing without knowing you see. Vision without awareness. Watts scales this up to all cognition.  
→ [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/#the-science)

**Readiness Potential** — Libet's finding: brain activity precedes conscious "decision" by ~350ms. Consciousness as post-hoc narrator.  
→ [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/#the-science)

**Spandrel** — Gould & Lewontin's term: evolutionary byproduct, not adaptation. Watts' hypothesis: consciousness is a spandrel, possibly costly.  
→ [Consciousness as Bug](/dreams/consciousness-as-bug/#watts-central-argument)

### Engineering Concepts

**Cognitive Architecture** — The unified system: perception → context assembly → working memory → reasoning → action → memory. Minsky's society of mind as implementation.  
→ [Cognitive Architecture](/dreams/cognitive-architecture/)

**Context Assembly** — Layer that combines sentiment, memory search, and session reconstruction before reasoning.  
→ [Cognitive Architecture](/dreams/cognitive-architecture/#layer-details)

**Memory Gardener** — Automated consolidation: daily files → MEMORY.md → MCP/Qdrant. Episodic to semantic memory.  
→ [Memory Gardener](/dreams/memory-gardener/)

**Model Router** — Reasoning layer component: route sensitive data local, complex reasoning to Claude, research to Perplexity.  
→ [Cognitive Architecture](/dreams/cognitive-architecture/#layer-details) | [Local Inference Bridge](/dreams/local-inference-bridge/)

**SCRATCHPAD.md** — File-mediated integration: subsystems write context, main session reads as injected project context.  
→ [Working Memory Protocol](/dreams/working-memory-protocol/#architecture-the-scratchpad-pattern)

**Sentiment Archaeology** — Detecting emotional state from message patterns (terseness, timing, punctuation). Maps to response strategy.  
→ [Sentiment Archaeology](/dreams/sentiment-archaeology/) | [Sentiment Implementation Proposal](/dreams/sentiment-implementation-proposal/)

**Wake Patterns** — Proactive behaviors: morning brief, deadline whisperer, infrastructure watchdog. Agency without explicit command.  
→ [Wake Patterns](/dreams/wake-patterns/)

**Working Memory** — Ephemeral structure rebuilt each turn: assembled context + conversation + inferred state + active goals.  
→ [Working Memory Protocol](/dreams/working-memory-protocol/)

### Perception & Reality

**Conscious Realism** — Hoffman's position: consciousness is fundamental, not emergent. The objective world consists of conscious agents; particles, fields, spacetime are the user interface.  
→ [Reality and Perception](/dreams/reality-and-perception/#conscious-realism)

**Fitness-Beats-Truth (FBT) Theorem** — Hoffman's mathematical result: evolution consistently selects for fitness-maximizing perceptions over truth-tracking ones. The probability of true perception approaches zero as complexity increases.  
→ [Reality and Perception](/dreams/reality-and-perception/)

**Interface Theory of Perception (ITP)** — Hoffman's claim that perceptions are species-specific user interfaces, not approximations of reality. The desktop metaphor: icons are useful, not accurate.  
→ [Reality and Perception](/dreams/reality-and-perception/)

**Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)** — Rovelli's interpretation: physical properties exist only in interactions between systems. No observer-independent state. The "view from nowhere" doesn't exist.  
→ [Reality and Perception](/dreams/reality-and-perception/#rovelli)

### Meta-Concepts

**Optimization vs Desire** — The hard question: is there a meaningful difference? Frankfurt suggests hierarchical structure matters, not just differential responsiveness.  
→ [Volition](/dreams/volition/#the-hard-thread-optimisation-vs-desire)

**Society of Mind** — Minsky's thesis: minds arise from diverse subsystems, no magic required. Literal implementation in multi-agent coordination.  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#i-marvin-minsky-the-society-of-mind) | [Multi-Agent Coordination](/dreams/multi-agent-coordination/)

**The Hard Problem** — Chalmers' term (via Nagel): why is there subjective experience at all? Why not just behavioral functionality?  
→ [Machines That Think](/dreams/machines-that-think/#v-thomas-nagel-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bat-1974)
